            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                AI tools are increasingly embedded in digital culture, creative work, and data analysis.
                For this lab, I evaluated two AI tools from different categories: ChatGPT (text and code
                assistance) and Adobe Firefly (image generation). I chose these tools because they are
                directly relevant to my coursework in Digital Culture and Data Analytics and represent
                common ways students and professionals interact with AI today. Using a four-part
                evaluation framework—Capabilities, Appropriate Use, Ethics, and Transparency—I tested
                each tools strengths, limits, and implications.

            <h2>Tool 1: ChatGPT</h2>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p><img src="images/Chat2.png" alt="ChatGPT generating">
                ChatGPT performs well at generating structured text, brainstorming ideas, summarizing
                concepts, and assisting with code explanations. During testing, I used it to outline
                academic reflections, explain HTML structure, and generate draft analyses. Output quality
                improved significantly when prompts were detailed and specific. However, the tool
                struggles with factual precision at times and can sound overly confident even when
                incorrect. It also tends to generalize unless pushed with constraints or examples.
            </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>
                ChatGPT is best used as a drafting and thinking partner rather than a final authority.
                It fits well into workflows that involve idea generation, early-stage writing, and
                learning unfamiliar technical concepts. Poor use cases include submitting AI-generated
                text as final academic work without revision or relying on it for original analysis or
                citation-heavy research. Human judgment is essential for interpretation, accuracy, and
                voice.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                ChatGPT is trained on a mixture of licensed data, human-created content, and publicly
                available text, which raises concerns about bias and authorship. The model can reproduce
                dominant cultural perspectives while marginalizing others. While safeguards exist to
                limit harmful content, gaps remain around attribution and overreliance. Users are
                responsible for ensuring originality and proper citation when using outputs.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Tool 2: Adobe Firefly</h2>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p><img src="images/Adobe.png" alt="Refined Adobe Firefly AI illustration after prompt iteration">
                Adobe Firefly excels at generating images from text prompts and integrating AI into
                familiar design workflows. I tested it by generating conceptual images related to media
                critique and digital culture themes. Firefly produces clean, visually polished images,
                especially for illustrative purposes. Its limitations appear when prompts
                require very specific details or realism, where outputs can feel generic or repetitive.
            </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>
                Firefly is well suited for concept art, visual brainstorming, and placeholder imagery
                in presentations or portfolios. It is less appropriate for projects requiring factual
                visual documentation or culturally specific representation. The tool works best as a
                supplement to human design skills, not a replacement for intentional visual storytelling.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                Adobe emphasizes that Firefly is trained on licensed and Adobe Stock content, positioning
                it as a more ethically sourced image generator. Despite this, questions remain around
                originality and the long-term impact on creative labor. Bias can still emerge through
                prompt interpretation and default visual norms embedded in training data.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                In my academic and professional work, I imagine using AI tools to accelerate early stages
                of thinking—drafting, organizing ideas, and visual exploration—while maintaining human
                control over interpretation and final output. Within the DCDA program, AI tools may
                reduce time spent on technical barriers but increase the importance of critical thinking,
                ethics, and media literacy. Skills like contextual analysis, storytelling, and ethical
                judgment remain uniquely human.
            </p>
            <p>
                As AI tools continue to evolve, important evaluation questions include: What data is this
                tool trained on? What assumptions does it embed? How transparent is its output? And how
                does it shift power, labor, or authorship? Developing these questions as habits is more
                valuable than mastering any single platform.
